            <div class="item_text">Pineapples are a tropical fruit that are cone shaped with a waxy
                tough skin that has small spines protruding from it. The inside flesh
                is yellow with a hard core in the middle. The leafy top, hard skin and
                core are not eaten.</div>

            <div class="item_text">In Hawaiian, “hala” means fruit, and “kahiki” means foreign. So “hala kahiki” translates to “foreign fruit.”<br>
                This is because pineapples originate from South America, specifically Brazil and Paraguay.<br>
                When they were taken over to Hawaii, the locals gave this name as they were an unknown fruit.</div>

            <div class="item_text">It might sound a little crazy, but did you know pineapples can eat you?<br>
                Pineapples contain an enzyme called bromelain. When we chew pineapples, bromelain is released and starts to break down proteins in our mouth.
                Fortunately, by the time it reaches our intestines, the enzyme is broken down, so we don’t have to worry about the pineapple eating away at us.

            <div class="item_text">The magnificent fruit was recorded in 2011 and grown by Christine McCallum from Bakewell in Australia.<br>
                It measured 12.6 inches (32cm) in length and had a circumference of 26 inches (66cm).<br>
                The fruit had a total weight of 18.3 lb. (8.28kg)! That’s almost as much as a watermelon. </div>
